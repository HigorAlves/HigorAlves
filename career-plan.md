## 🎯 Career Vision

### 🌟 Long-Term Aspiration
Become a **Staff Software Engineer** and later a **Solution Architect Specialist**, with deep expertise in **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and strong open-source/community involvement in **JAMStack** ecosystems.

### 🧠 About Me
**Senior Software Engineer | JavaScript & TypeScript Specialist | Backend-Focused | Scalable Systems & Cloud Architecture**

I’m a Full-Stack Engineer with a decade of experience and I deeply specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript. My primary focus is backend development, where I design scalable systems, architect APIs, and integrate cloud infrastructure. I also bring solid frontend experience to deliver consistent, full-stack solutions from database to interface.

I have hands-on expertise with Node.js, Next.js, and Remix, along with modern technologies like server actions, edge functions, and React Server Components. On the data side, I’ve worked with relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL and cloud-native options like DynamoDB and CosmosDB. I’m also experienced with tools like Prisma and Drizzle ORM to keep codebases clean and maintainable.

My career has been marked by impactful contributions: reducing infrastructure costs through better backend architecture, improving application performance and reliability through thoughtful refactoring, and accelerating delivery timelines by introducing modern tooling and processes. I care deeply about writing clean, testable code and building robust, easy-to-evolve systems.

Fluent in English at a certified C2 level and based in Brazil, I bring strong communication skills, teaching experience, and a collaborative mindset to every team I work with. I’m passionate about solving meaningful technical problems, mentoring others, and continuously growing my craft.

## 📌 Career Planning Best Practices (Inspired by Big Techs)

- **Set SMART Goals**: Clear objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound
- **Use a Personal Career Doc**: Maintain a living document like this to reflect, realign and document wins
- **Frequent 1:1s**: Use meetings with your manager to align progress, highlight growth, and course-correct if needed
- **Build a Brag Document**: Log your achievements quarterly (code contributions, mentorship, project ownership)
- **Mentor and Be Mentored**: Take and give mentorship as a growth multiplier
- **Study Internal Ladders**: Look at frameworks like Google’s [Eng Ladder](https://levels.fyi) for expectations by level
- **Communicate Impact**: Share how your work moves the business or team forward
- **Prepare for Interviews Always**: Keep coding, system design and behavioral prep fresh
- **Set Quarterly Goals**: Use OKRs or personal goal reviews to stay on track
