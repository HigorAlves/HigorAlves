# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Software Engineer** focused on Front-end engineering and architecture and I'm building stuff at [@natahouse](https://github.com/natahouse).

I really enjoy studying the engineering behind the Front End, I love understanding how the Browser works and how Javascript is parsed. Love to share knowledge and contribute to free software.
