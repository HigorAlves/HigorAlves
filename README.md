# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer focused on Front-end engineering and architecture and I'm building stuff at @natahouse.

I really enjoy studying the engineering behind the Front End, I love understanding how the Browser works and how Javascript is parsed. Love to share knowledge and contribute to free software.
