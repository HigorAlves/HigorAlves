# Hey Folks 🍀

I have a diverse background in software development and have worked on a variety of projects. My experience includes leading technical debt reduction efforts, creating design systems, developing APIs and cross-platform applications, and implementing automated tests and regression versions. I also worked on front-end development, user experience design, and improving performance and fixing bugs. Additionally, I have experience in migrating legacy codebases to more efficient microservices structures, which can improve system performance and maintainability.
