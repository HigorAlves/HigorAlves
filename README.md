# Hey Folks üçÄ

I‚Äôm a Full-Stack Engineer with a decade of experience and I deeply specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript. My primary focus is backend development, where I design scalable systems, architect APIs, and integrate cloud infrastructure. I also bring solid frontend experience to deliver consistent, full-stack solutions from database to interface.

I have hands-on expertise with Node.js, Next.js, and Remix, along with modern technologies like server actions, edge functions, and React Server Components. On the data side, I‚Äôve worked with relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL and cloud-native options like DynamoDB and CosmosDB. I‚Äôm also experienced with tools like Prisma and Drizzle ORM to keep codebases clean and maintainable.

My career has been marked by impactful contributions: reducing infrastructure costs through better backend architecture, improving application performance and reliability through thoughtful refactoring, and accelerating delivery timelines by introducing modern tooling and processes. I care deeply about writing clean, testable code and building robust, easy-to-evolve systems.

Fluent in English at a certified C2 level and based in Brazil, I bring strong communication skills, teaching experience, and a collaborative mindset to every team I work with. I‚Äôm passionate about solving meaningful technical problems, mentoring others, and continuously growing my craft.
